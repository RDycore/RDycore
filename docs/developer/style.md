# RDycore (C) Style Guide

Here we provide a simple style guide for C code within the RDycore library. This
style guide applies mainly to source code within the RDycore C library itself.
The corresponding Fortran library is a thin hand-written wrapper around the C
library that doesn't leave much room for "style," so there is no Fortran style
guide.
