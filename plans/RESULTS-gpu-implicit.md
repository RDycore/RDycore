# GPU-implicit session log (P2-P4 of PLAN-fv-gpu-adaptation)

Branch `adams/gpu-implicit` (off `adams/manning-draft` @ 6765cd86). Second
agent, per plans/gpu-session-kickoff.md.

## P2 — device matrices, host physics

### Code (laptop-verified, commits c1487f6d + 054717cb)

- `CreateAnalyticJacobianCOO` no longer hardwires MATAIJ: type comes from
  `DMGetMatType` (`-dm_mat_type`; default unchanged), plus a prefixed
  `MatSetFromOptions` so `-rhs_jac_mat_type` overrides THIS matrix alone.
  (A bare `-mat_type` is also consumed inside DMCreateMatrix_Plex and flips
  the FD twin in the jacobian tests — segfaults MATCOLORINGSL on an empty
  BAIJKokkos, whose host CSR is only built at assembly.)
- Blocked COO for BAIJ types via the fork's `MatCOOUseBlockIndices`:
  block-index pattern (9x fewer index entries), values = one dense row-major
  3x3 block per entry == exactly the P1 values layout, so the assembly loop
  is untouched. Detected at configure time by grepping petscmat.h ->
  `RDY_HAVE_MAT_COO_BLOCK_INDICES` (config.h); builds against stock PETSc
  unchanged.
- Only types that IMPLEMENT blocked COO opt in: `*baijkokkos`, `*baijcuda`,
  `mpibaij` (host twin). Plain `seqbaij` ignores the flag by design and
  would misread block indices as scalar (verified: rel err ~1) — it keeps
  scalar COO. Serial host blocked-COO testing: force `mpibaij`.

### Laptop verification (fork stack)

New PETSc arch `arch-macosx-gnu-rdycore-kokkos-O` of ~/Codes/petsc-claude
(RDycore dep set + kokkos host); RDycore worktree build `build-claude`.
- `ctest -R "adjoint|calibrate|jacobian"`: 14/14 (both this stack and the
  petsc_gem `build_rev` stack).
- `test_swe_jacobian_global` FD-vs-analytic rel err 1.5-1.9e-8 (gate 1e-6),
  IDENTICAL across `-rhs_jac_mat_type` in {aij, baij, mpibaij, aijkokkos,
  baijkokkos}, np 1 and 2.
- Standalone fork check: blocked COO on seqbaijkokkos is exact (0.0 diff vs
  MatSetValuesBlocked reference, repeated blocks summed). NB
  MatSetPreallocationCOO may permute its index arrays in place.

### Perlmutter status / environment findings (IMPORTANT)

- PM moved to CPE 26.03: default `cudatoolkit/13.2`, `cray-mpich/9.1.0`
  whose `libmpi_gtl_cuda.so` REQUIRES `libcudart.so.13` — CUDA 12 builds of
  new arches are no longer linkable with the default MPICH. The
  `--download-cudss` archive is cuda12-only => cudss is OFF in the new arch
  until a cuda13 archive is wired (P4 coarse-solve fallback: host lu).
- `arch-perlmutter-opt-gcc-kokkos-cuda` (shared with the other agent) was
  STALE w.r.t. the 3 stale-cache-fix commits; incrementally rebuilt Aug 21
  (touched the 14 device TUs including changed headers first — header-dep
  gotcha). CAVEAT: that arch records `CUDAC = nvcc` (PATH-resolved), so the
  rebuilt objects compiled under nvcc 13.2 into a 12.9-configured arch. It
  links; a from-scratch reconfigure under the new CPE is the clean fix if
  anything smells.
- New arch for RDycore: `arch-perlmutter-claude-kokkos-cuda-O` = device
  pipeline (kokkos/kokkos-kernels/metis/parmetis/triangle, cuda 13.2,
  minus cudss) + RDycore deps (exodus/hdf5/libceed/muparser/netcdf/pnetcdf/
  zlib/revolve), COPTFLAGS=-O2. Config script:
  ~/Codes/petsc-configs/arch-perlmutter-claude-kokkos-cuda-O.py (+ build
  script build-claude-kokkos-cuda.sh). Building at session time.
- RDycore worktree ~/Codes/rdycore-manning now on `adams/gpu-implicit`;
  `cmake-claude-gpu.sh` stages `build-claude-gpu` against the new arch.
- Run dir: `$SCRATCH/gpu-implicit` (mesh+IC linked, beuler_dt1.yaml,
  `p2_ab.sbatch` staged: CPU baseline, GPU-binary/host-mats sanity, then
  aijkokkos and baijkokkos at n4 and n64, all dt=1 20 steps, fgmres+pbjacobi
  rtol 1e-3, solution monitors for trajectory comparison).
- The OTHER agent was actively iterating the dt>=5 robustness question this
  morning in $SCRATCH/manning-beuler (d_dt5_*, b_dt5_* logs; interactive job
  on nid001000): at dt=5 with basic LS the FIRST Newton linear solve
  diverges (300 its, pbjacobi) — a linear-solver hardness problem, not just
  the line search. P4 waits on that thread; staying out of their dir.

## P3 — device assembly (design sketch, not started)

- swe_roe_flux_jacobian_petsc.h is pure self-contained scalar math — ports
  to KOKKOS_INLINE_FUNCTION nearly mechanically (drop PetscFunctionBegin/
  PetscCall error plumbing, keep branches).
- Setup-time: per-edge and per-cell OFFSET tables into the COO values array
  (host cursor replay), device views of static geometry (l, r, wl, wr, sn,
  cn per edge; dz_dx, dz_dy per cell; owned flags folded in).
- Assembly: parallel_for internal edges -> interior region; parallel_for
  owned cells -> diagonal region; boundary edges stay HOST (O(surface)) in
  a contiguous slice of the values array, deep_copied in.
- MatSetValuesCOO with a device pointer (kokkos impls detect memtype).
- State: -dm_vec_type kokkos + VecKokkosGetDeviceView of u_local after
  DMGlobalToLocal; manning via device view of material_properties.
