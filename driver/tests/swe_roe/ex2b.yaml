# The mesh contains three boundaries on which following BCs are being
# applied:
# 1. "boundary"    : Reflecting wall BC
# 2. "top_wall"    : Reflecting wall BC
# 3. "bottom_wall" : Critical outflow BC
#
# Below we define BCs for "top_wall" and "bottom_wall", but do not specify
# the BC for "boundary". If no BC is specified for a boundary, the reflecting
# wall BC is assumed.
